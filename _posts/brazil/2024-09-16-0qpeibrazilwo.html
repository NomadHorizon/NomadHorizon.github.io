  <!-- Main Content - Part 4 -->
  <h2 id="part4">Best Time to Visit</h2>
  <p>Wondering when to book your trip to Rio? The best time to visit Rio is during its summer months, from December to March. This is when the weather is warm and ideal for enjoying the city's beaches and outdoor attractions. However, be prepared for crowds, as this is also the peak tourist season. If you prefer fewer tourists, consider visiting in April or May, when the weather is still pleasant but the city is quieter.</p>

  <p>If you're a fan of festivals, visiting during Carnival in February is a must! Just be sure to book your accommodations well in advance, as hotels fill up quickly during this time.</p>
